# 🟢 Node.js JSON API Server – Portfolio Project

This is a lightweight backend project built in pure Node.js that serves structured JSON data via a local API endpoint. It’s designed to demonstrate a data analyst’s ability to work with APIs, backend logic, and clean data formats — all without using external frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

As part of my data analytics portfolio, this project simulates how a backend server can expose structured data (e.g., user or product info) through a clean JSON API — similar to what modern apps and dashboards consume in real-time.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – backend runtime environment
- **Native `http` & `fs` modules** – no frameworks used
- **JSON** – for storing and returning data
- **VS Code + GitHub Desktop** – for editing and version control
